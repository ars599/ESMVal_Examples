- This is an updated version of the model used for CMIP5 and described at http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/cmip5 ; changes are : i) real salt and water fluxes between SeaIce and Ocean, ii) increased ice depth on permanent ice sheets to avoid complete melt under extreme global warming, iii) using a 2012 version of Szopa et al. prescribed aerosols and iv) solar forcing is no more the TIM-corrected one (i.e. values are around 1365 W/m**2) . A few variants of physics are used, please see the metadata field named comment. Comparing to physics #1 : physics #2 adds melt ponds; physics #3 uses 60 atmospheric levels instead of 31; physics #4 also, and adds a stratospheric chemical scheme ; physics #5 integrates biophysical coupling between phytoplankton and light penetration into the ocean as described in Lengaigne et al;, 2009
