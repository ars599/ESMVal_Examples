    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero.

For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero.

Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium.

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860.

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero.

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1. PCMDI experiment name = 1 percent per year CO2 (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were taken from 1 January of year 1 of the 1860 control model experiment named ESM2M_pi-control_C1. In the ESM2M-C1_1pct-co2_2x_T1 experiment atmospheric CO2 levels were prescribed to increase from their initial mixing ratio level of 286.15 ppmv at a compounded rate of +1 percent per year until year 70 (the point of doubling). CO2 levels were held constant at 574.2349 ppmv from year 71 through the end of the 200 year long experiment. For the entire 200 year duration of the experiment, all non-CO2 forcing agents (CH4, N2O, tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt, and solar irradiance) were held constant at values representative of year 1860. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>

    <attribute:comment>GFDL experiment name = ESM2M_pi-control_C1. PCMDI experiment name = pre-industrial control (run1). Initial conditions for this experiment were derived from a multi-step process involving a multi-century spin-up integration to allow both the physical climate system and the carbon cycle to come into a quasi-dynamic equilibrium with year 1860 radiative forcing. First, a dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was spun up with forcing agents obtained from a previous CM2.1 control integration at levels representative of 1860, and potential (i.e., no land use) vegetation. Second, the spun up dynamic vegetation and carbon cycle model was coupled to an atmosphere model using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols and spun up with time-varying observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice values. Third, an ocean + sea ice model was spun up with initial conditions for sea ice, ocean potential temperature and salinity derived from late 20th century observations. The ESM was coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry component which uses observed fields of various chemically-active species. The fully-coupled ESM was initialized from present day conditions derived from the three steps above, and the radiative forcing was set back to 1860 conditions. The model was run for several centuries to adjust to those conditions. For the first 248 years of the spin-up, the physical climate was allowed to achieve a quasi-radiative equilibrium with the constant 1860 radiative forcing using potential, static vegetation and a fixed pCO2 value of 286 ppm, while a sponge was applied to the actual atmospheric CO2 values back to 286 ppm to avoid drift. Physical climate equilibrium was established using four coarse criteria: TOA net radiative flux less than +/- 0.1 W/m-2, global 2-m air temperature drift less than 0.1C per century, annual SST biases less than 10C and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) transport southward at 30N greater than 10 Sv. At year 249 of the spin-up, dynamic vegetation was activated and the model was integrated for an additional 200 years after which time the land photosynthesis routine was allowed to feel the model's own atmospheric CO2. After another ~150 years, the soil carbon was set to a quasi-equilibrium state using an offline analytic procedure, and the model integration was continued until the land and ocean carbon stored reached equilibrium. A net carbon flux of each component of less than 20 PgC per century and leading to net atmospheric response of less than 10 ppm per century was the criteria used for determining equilibrium. Year 1 of the archived ESM2M_pi-control_C1 experiment data begins at the end of this adjustment period. ESM2M_pi-control_C1 forcing agents representative of conditions circa-1860 include the well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O), tropospheric and stratospheric O3, tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, dust, sea salt and solar irradiance. This integration did not include land use change (i.e., a "potential vegetation" integration) and volcanic aerosols were zero. The direct effect of tropospheric aerosols is calculated by the model, but not the indirect effects.</attribute:comment>
